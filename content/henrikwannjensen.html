      <p>Dr. Henrik Wann Jensen is a former Research Associate at Stanford University 
        where he worked in the computer graphics group on realistic image synthesis, 
        global illumination, and new appearance models. He is now a professor 
        at the University of California of San Diego. His contributions to computer 
        graphics include the photon mapping algorithm for global illumination, 
        and the first BSSRDF for simulating subsurface scattering in translucent 
        materials. He is the author of &quot;Realistic Image Synthesis using Photon 
        Mapping&quot;, AK Peters 2001. Prior to coming to Stanford in 1999, he 
        was a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, and a research scientist in industry 
        where he added photon maps to a commercial renderer. He received his M.Sc. 
        and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Technical University of Denmark 
        for developing the photon mapping method. </p>
