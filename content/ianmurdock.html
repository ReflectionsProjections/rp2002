      <p>Ian Murdock is the founder of Debian, one of the first Linux distributions 
        and still one of the most popular with millions of users worldwide. He 
        led the Debian project from its inception in 1993 to 1996, building Debian 
        from an idea to a worldwide organization of more than 100 people in less 
        than three years. Today, Debian is widely considered one of the most successful 
        and influential open source projects in the world. Ian is also co-founder 
        and chairman of Progeny Linux Systems, a provider of Linux-based software 
        and services based in Indianapolis, Indiana. A longtime Linux user, developer, 
        and advocate, Ian was the original architect of dpkg, the first package 
        management system for Linux. He was also a founding director of Linux 
        International, Software in the Public Interest, and the Open Source Initiative. 
        Ian holds a B.S. in computer science from Purdue University. </p>
