      <p>Marcus Brinkmann was born in Dortmund, a town located in northwest Germany, 
        that is currently undergoing a change from an industrial to a service 
        based economy. Presently, he is a student at the Ruhr-University- Bochum 
        studying mathematics and physics. At the age of seven, Marcus discovered 
        computers, and programming soon became a hobby. It was not until the Internet 
        replaced the German Btx, however, that he became part of the world-wide 
        community of free software developers. He considers this essential to 
        his maturity as a programmer: it not only permitted him to easily retrieve 
        and study large amounts of real world source code under a free software 
        license, but made it possible for him to communicate and eventually collaborate 
        with the programmers. After becoming familiar with the Debian GNU/Linux 
        distribution, Marcus realized its value and decided to become a contributor. 
        In 1997, after a long time user of GNU/Linux systems, Marcus joined the 
        Debian project to help develop their GNU/Linux distribution. The following 
        year, he discovered the GNU Hurd and refocused his efforts to work on 
        a binary distribution of the GNU system. Since then, he has joined the 
        GNU project and now works on several of its software packages, principally 
        the GNU Hurd.</p>
