      <p>As the founder and leader of the GNOME Foundation and a board member 
        of the Free Software Foundation, Miguel is one of the foremost luminaries 
        in the Linux development community. With his seemingly boundless energy, 
        Miguel has galvanized the effort to make Linux accessible and available 
        to the average computer user. He brings this same excitement to his role 
        as CTO of Ximian. Miguel was instrumental in porting Linux to the SPARC 
        architecture and led development of the Midnight Commander file manager 
        and the Gnumeric spreadsheet. He is also a primary author of the design 
        of the Bonobo component model, which leads the way in the development 
        of large-scale applications in GNOME.</p>
