His current         projects include an implementation of the MPI Message-Passing Standard,         research into programming models for parallel architectures, and parallel         performance analysis tools. Past interests include automated theorem proving,         logic programming, and parallel computing. He is a co-author of five books         in automated reasoning and parallel computing, and a leading member of         teams that produced the Argonne theorem proving systems, the Aurora parallel         Prolog system, and the MPICH implementation of the MPI message-passing         interface standard. He is the author of more than seventy-five research         articles in mathematics, automated deduction, and parallel computing.</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
