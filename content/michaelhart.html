      <p>Michael S. Hart was one of the first 100 members of the virtual community 
        that has since become known as the Internet and World Wide Web. In 1971 
        with the great help of two operators of what was then a huge million dollar 
        mainframe computer that is today totally outclassed by calculators well 
        under $100, started what turned out to be the first &quot;site&quot; on 
        what became the Internet--but no one really paid much attention to this 
        site until 1988 when the Internet finally passed 250,000 members and it 
        finally had a large enough population to support conversations on world 
        wide ranges of topics. By 1991 the word &quot;Internet&quot; finally was 
        able to appear for the first time on the front page or cover of any of 
        the major media, and fittingly enough it was the article about that very 
        Project Gutenberg site in the Wall St. Journal.</p>
      <p> Michael received a degree in &quot;Human-Machine Interfaces&quot; [1973], 
        but academia was not interested in the distribution of &quot;virtual libraries 
        of free electronic texts&quot; so after three aborted grad school efforts 
        to pursue the &quot;Neo-Industrial Revolution,&quot; he is still pursuing 
        this effort as the largest &quot;shoestring project.&quot; At this moment 
        Project Gutenberg is approaching 5,000 &quot;eTexts.&quot; Michael hopes 
        to post 10,000 eTexts in his lifetime without any major funding, and hopes 
        to post 1,000,000 with major funding.</p>
